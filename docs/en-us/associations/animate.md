# 🎆 UCCU Anime Club

The UCCU Anime Club (Ultimate Comic & Cosplay Union) is a society at BNBU formed by students who love ACGN (Anime, Comic, Game, and Novel) culture. Through decades of dedicated management by successive generations of enthusiasts, it has grown into a club with over a hundred members. The UCCU Anime Club aims to provide BNBU students with a platform to exchange and share various ACGN information, organize activities, and promote the culture.

The club currently has three administrative departments: General Affairs, Publicity;

and seven interest departments: Otaku Dance, Cosplay, Game Research, Voice Acting, Light Music, Photography, and Creative Writing.

We welcome all fans of ACGN subculture to find like-minded friends and a personal space to call their own. UCCU-chan looks forward to your joining!
