# 🎙️ Cultural & Arts Clubs

## Photography & Visual Arts Club
What is “beauty”? Is it the deep spring like the sea, summer mountains like emerald, or the fireworks of everyday life, vast rivers and mountains; is it the warm and dazzling enamel in your hand, or the light that passes through someone’s eyes when they look up at you? PGAC Photography & Visual Arts Club, as the only photography club and the largest visual arts club at our school, is a utopia for photography enthusiasts and visual art lovers. Each academic year, we host various photo and design exhibitions, offer photography courses and design workshops, giving more students the opportunity to experience and create beauty. At PGAC, we capture light and shadow, sketch the extraordinary, and use cameras and brushes to create your own unique dreamscape. If you love photography and design, and have a longing for and pursuit of “beauty,” welcome to PGAC, where we become catchers and creators of beauty together.
